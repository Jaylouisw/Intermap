# Aggressive Mapping Implementation - Change Summary

## Overview
Implemented complete aggressive comprehensive mapping strategy with:
- ✅ Automatic /24 subnet mapping
- ✅ Multi-perspective routing (no deduplication)
- ✅ Collaborative dead IP detection
- ✅ Unlimited traceroutes (no rate limiting)
- ✅ Increased hop limits (30 → 64)

## Files Modified

### 1. Configuration: `config/default.yaml`
**Changes**:
- `max_hops`: 30 → 64 (deeper path discovery)
- `interval`: 3600 → 300 seconds (5 minutes between rounds)
- `max_traceroutes_per_hour`: 10 → 0 (unlimited)
- Added `auto_map_own_subnet: true`
- Added `enable_rate_limiting: false`
- Added `verification: "intermap-verification"` channel

**Impact**: Enables aggressive unlimited mapping with subnet auto-discovery.

### 2. IPFS Client: `src/ipfs/client.py`
**Changes**:
- Added `VERIFICATION_CHANNEL = "intermap-verification"` constant

**Impact**: Enables dead IP verification communication between nodes.

### 3. Core Node Logic: `src/node/node.py`
**Major Changes**:

#### Added IPReachability Class
```python
@dataclass
class IPReachability:
    ip: str
    reachable_by: set      # Nodes that can reach this IP
    unreachable_by: set    # Nodes that cannot reach this IP
    last_verified: datetime
    verification_pending: bool = False
```
Tracks consensus on IP reachability across all nodes.

#### Updated TopologyNode Class
- Added `self.ip_reachability: Dict[str, IPReachability]` - tracks all IPs
- Added `self.trace_targets: set` - all IPs to trace (peers + subnet)

#### New Methods

**`_add_own_subnet_targets()`** (lines 280-304)
- Calculates /24 subnet from external IP
- Adds all 254 IPs (excluding self) to trace targets
- Provides comprehensive local network perspective

**`_handle_verification_message()`** (lines 396-460)
- Handles `verification_request` messages
- Immediately traceroutes requested IP
- Sends `verification_response` with result
- Updates local IP reachability tracking

**`_ip_verification_loop()`** (lines 462-503)
- Runs every 5 minutes
- Checks for IPs with 0 reachable_by and ≥3 unreachable_by
- Removes dead IPs from graph
- Publishes updated topology

#### Modified Methods

**`start()` method** (lines 227-239)
- Subscribes to verification channel
- Calls `_add_own_subnet_targets()` if enabled
- Starts `_ip_verification_loop()` task

**`_traceroute_loop()` method** (lines 527-637)
- Now traces ALL targets (peers + subnet + verification requests)
- Removed rate limiting logic
- Removed peer-priority selection
- Tracks IP reachability for every trace
- Broadcasts verification request on failed traces
- 10-second delay between individual traces
- 5-minute delay between full rounds

### 4. Graph Module: `src/graph/gexf_generator.py`
**Changes**:
- Added `remove_node()` method to NetworkGraph class

**Implementation**:
```python
def remove_node(self, ip_address: str):
    """Remove a node and all its edges from the graph."""
    if ip_address not in self.nodes:
        return
    del self.nodes[ip_address]
    edges_to_remove = [k for k in self.edges.keys() if ip_address in k]
    for edge_key in edges_to_remove:
        del self.edges[edge_key]
```

**Impact**: Enables dead IP removal from topology graph.

## New Features in Detail

### Feature 1: Automatic Subnet Mapping
**User Request**: "have every user automatically map the full subnet of their public ip"

**Implementation**:
1. On startup, node detects external IP (e.g., `203.0.113.45`)
2. Calculates /24 subnet (`203.0.113.0/24`)
3. Adds all 254 IPs to `trace_targets` set
4. Traceroute loop continuously traces all targets

**Example**:
```
INFO - Added 254 IPs from own subnet 203.0.113.0/24 to trace targets
INFO - Starting traceroute cycle for 254 targets
INFO - Tracing route to: 203.0.113.1
INFO - Tracing route to: 203.0.113.2
...
```

### Feature 2: No Deduplication
**User Request**: "even if an ip is already in the main map, they should map because each user has a different perspective"

**Implementation**:
- Removed peer selection logic
- All nodes trace to all targets
- No "already mapped" checks
- Each node contributes unique routing perspective

**Example**:
```
# Node in Tokyo
203.0.113.45 → 8.8.8.8: [Tokyo ISP] → [Japan Backbone] → [Pacific Cable] → Google

# Node in New York
198.51.100.78 → 8.8.8.8: [NY ISP] → [US Backbone] → [Local Peering] → Google
```

### Feature 3: Collaborative Dead IP Detection
**User Request**: "if a user cannot find a route to another ip but it has already been mapped, it should flag that ip as potentially down/unassigned, and request ALL users trace a route to it ASAP"

**Implementation**:
1. Node fails to traceroute to IP that exists in graph
2. Marks IP as `verification_pending = True`
3. Broadcasts `verification_request` on `intermap-verification` channel
4. All other nodes receive request
5. Each node immediately attempts traceroute
6. Each node sends `verification_response` with result
7. Requesting node tracks responses in `ip_reachability`

**Message Flow**:
```
Node A: Traceroute to 203.0.113.99 failed
Node A: Broadcast verification_request
Node B: Receive request → Trace → Send response (unreachable)
Node C: Receive request → Trace → Send response (unreachable)
Node D: Receive request → Trace → Send response (unreachable)
Node A: Consensus: 3 unreachable, 0 reachable → Remove from graph
```

### Feature 4: Dead IP Removal
**User Request**: "if no route is found to an IP address by any user it should be removed from the map"

**Implementation**:
- `_ip_verification_loop()` runs every 5 minutes
- Checks each IP in `ip_reachability`
- If `len(reachable_by) == 0` and `len(unreachable_by) >= 3`:
  - Remove from `network_graph.nodes`
  - Remove all connected edges
  - Clean up `ip_reachability` tracking
  - Publish updated topology to IPFS

**Example**:
```
INFO - IP 203.0.113.99 is unreachable by 3 nodes - marking for removal
INFO - Removing dead IP 203.0.113.99 from network graph
INFO - Removed 1 dead IPs from map
```

### Feature 5: Unlimited Traceroutes
**User Request**: "any traceroute should not be hop limited and there shouldnt be rate limiting on traceroutes"

**Implementation**:
- `max_hops`: Increased from 30 to 64
- `max_traceroutes_per_hour`: Set to 0 (unlimited)
- `enable_rate_limiting`: Set to false
- `interval`: Reduced from 3600s to 300s
- Removed all rate limit checks from code

**Impact**:
```
Before: 10 traces per hour (1 every 6 minutes)
After: ~360 traces per hour (1 every 10 seconds)
```

## Testing

### Quick Test
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start IPFS
ipfs daemon

# Terminal 2: Start node
python -m src.main
```

**Expected Output**:
```
INFO - External IP: 203.0.113.45
INFO - Added 254 IPs from own subnet 203.0.113.0/24 to trace targets
INFO - Node abc123 started successfully
INFO - Subscribed to intermap-verification channel
INFO - Starting traceroute cycle for 254 targets
INFO - Tracing route to: 203.0.113.1
...
```

### Verification Test
```bash
# Terminal 1: Subscribe to verification channel
ipfs pubsub sub intermap-verification

# Terminal 2: Start node and trigger failed traceroute
# (node will broadcast verification requests)
```

### Full Test Suite
See `TESTING_AGGRESSIVE.md` for comprehensive testing procedures.

## Performance Characteristics

### Expected Resource Usage
- **CPU**: 5-20% (modern hardware)
- **Memory**: 50-200 MB (scales with graph size)
- **Network**: 1-5 Mbps (aggressive mapping)
- **IPFS Storage**: ~1-10 MB per topology snapshot

### Scaling Considerations
- **Single Node**: Maps 254 IPs every 5 minutes
- **10 Nodes**: Collective coverage of 2,540 IPs
- **100 Nodes**: Collective coverage of 25,400 IPs
- **Graph Size**: Can grow to 10,000+ nodes with active participation

### Bottlenecks
1. **Network**: ISP rate limiting on ICMP traffic
2. **IPFS**: PubSub message volume with many nodes
3. **Memory**: Large graphs (10,000+ nodes) need RAM
4. **CPU**: XML parsing for large GEXF files

## Privacy & Security

### Maintained
- ✅ Private IPs still filtered (RFC1918, link-local, loopback)
- ✅ Only public IPs shared
- ✅ Anonymous node IDs (UUIDs)
- ✅ No personal information

### New Considerations
- ⚠️ Subnet mapping reveals your network range
- ⚠️ Aggressive probing may trigger IDS/IPS
- ⚠️ ISP may rate-limit excessive ICMP traffic
- ⚠️ Graph data is public on IPFS

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Test subnet mapping with `python -m src.main`
2. Verify configuration: `cat config/default.yaml`
3. Monitor logs for verification messages
4. Check GEXF output: `ls -lh output/`

### Multi-Node Testing
1. Deploy on 3+ machines/VMs
2. Verify peer discovery
3. Test verification protocol
4. Observe dead IP removal

### Production Deployment
1. Configure firewall for IPFS (port 4001)
2. Set up log rotation
3. Monitor resource usage
4. Consider rate limiting if ISP complains

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No subnet targets added"**
- Verify `auto_map_own_subnet: true` in config
- Check external IP detection: `python -m src.nat_detection`

**"Verification messages not received"**
- Ensure IPFS daemon running: `ipfs daemon`
- Check firewall not blocking port 4001

**"Dead IPs not removed"**
- Need ≥3 nodes reporting unreachable
- Wait for 5-minute verification loop cycle

**"Rate limited by ISP"**
- Increase `interval` in config
- Reduce traceroute frequency
